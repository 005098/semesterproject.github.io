<h1>ROSA PARKS</h1>
<p><b>Rosa Parks (1913—2005)</b> helped initiate the <b>civil rights movement</b> in the United States when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a <b>Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955.</b> Her actions inspired the leaders of the local Black community to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted more than a year—during which Parks not coincidentally lost her job—and ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Over the next half-century, Parks became a nationally recognized symbol of dignity and strength in the struggle to end entrenched <b>racial segregation.<b/></p>

<p>Rosa’s mother was a teacher, and the family valued education. Rosa moved to Montgomery, Alabama, at age 11 and eventually attended high school there, a laboratory school at the Alabama State Teachers’ College for Negroes. She left at 16, early in 11th grade, because she needed to care for her dying grandmother and, shortly thereafter, her chronically ill mother. In 1932, at 19, she married Raymond Parks, a self-educated man 10 years her senior who worked as a barber and was a long-time member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He supported Rosa in her efforts to earn her high-school diploma, which she ultimately did the following year.</p>

<p>Raymond and Rosa, who worked as a seamstress, became respected members of Montgomery’s large African American community.
   Co-existing with white people in a city governed by “Jim Crow” (segregation) laws, however, was fraught with daily frustrations: 
   Black people could attend only certain (inferior) schools, could drink only from specified water fountains and could borrow books
   only from the “Black” library, among other restrictions.

On Thursday, December 1, 1955, the 42-year-old Rosa Parks was
commuting home from a long day of work at the Montgomery Fair 
department store by bus. Black residents of Montgomery often 
avoided municipal buses if possible because they found the 
Negroes-in-back policy so demeaning. Nonetheless, 70 percent 
or more riders on a typical day were Black, and on this day 
Rosa Parks was one of them.

Segregation was written into law; the front of a Montgomery
bus was reserved for white citizens, and the seats behind 
them for Black citizens. However, it was only by custom that
bus drivers had the authority to ask a Black person to give 
up a seat for a white rider. There were contradictory Montgomery
laws on the books: One said segregation must be enforced, but 
another, largely ignored, said no person (white or Black) 
could be asked to give up a seat even if there were no other
seat on the bus available.
