<h1>ROSA PARKS</h1>
<p><b>Rosa Parks (1913—2005)</b> helped initiate the <b>civil rights movement</b> in the United States when she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a <b>Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955.</b> Her actions inspired the leaders of the local Black community to organize the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Led by a young Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the boycott lasted more than a year—during which Parks not coincidentally lost her job—and ended only when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. Over the next half-century, Parks became a nationally recognized symbol of dignity and strength in the struggle to end entrenched <b>racial segregation.<b/></p>
